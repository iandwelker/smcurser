# SMCurser

A tui client for [SMServer](https://github.com/ianwelker/smserver), written in Rust using the [tui-rs framework](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs). This is a rewrite of [SMServer_receiver](https://github.com/ianwelker/smserver_receiver), but using Rust, fixing a lot of issues, and adding a lot of features.
